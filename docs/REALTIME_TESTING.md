## Usage Tips

### Before Running Scripts

Make sure your environment variables are set:

```bash
# Required for realtime testing
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Common Scenarios

**Test if realtime is working:**

```bash
node scripts/test-realtime.js
# Then add/edit/delete a meal in your app
```

**Debug specific table issues:**

```bash
node scripts/test-realtime.js meal_nutrition 300
# Monitor for 5 minutes
```

**Monitor all tables during testing:**

```bash
node scripts/test-realtime.js multi
# Watch all meal-related tables
```

## Development Notes

-   All scripts are designed to be safe for production databases
-   Real-time tests only listen, they don't modify data
-   Scripts will timeout automatically to prevent hanging processes
-   Use these during development to verify functionality before deploying
